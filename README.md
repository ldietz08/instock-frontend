## How It's Made

**HTML, SASS, JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, Express.js, MySQL, Knex.js, Axios**

**React**: JavaScript library to build out user interfaces<br>
**MySQL**: Relational Database Management System<br>
**Node**: JavaScript runtime environment<br>
**Express**: Web application framework for Node.js<br>
**Knex.js**: SQL query builder used to model schema creation, table migrations, connection pooling and seeding. <br>
**Axios**: Promise-based HTTP client for Node.js

## The Team

Natalia and I were responsible for building out the backend of this project with Node, Express and MySQL.

This frontend was built in collaboration with:

Natalia (https://github.com/Awatanka) <br>
Su (https://github.com/Su0112) <br>
Caty (https://github.com/Caty115)<br>

## Installation:

1. Clone this repository - [instock-duncan](https://github.com/ldietz08/instock-duncan) <br>
   and the backend respository [instock-api-duncan](https://github.com/ldietz08/instock-backend)

2. Install the required dependencies using: `npm i`

### Environment Variables

**Frontend:**
Add the following variables in .env file:

`REACT_APP_API_URL=https://localhost:8080`

**Backend:**

`PORT = 8080`
`DB_LOCAL_DBNAME="Warehouse"`<br>
`DB_LOCAL_USER="YOUR DB USER NAME"`<br>
`DB_LOCAL_PASSWORD="YOUR DB PASSWORD"`<br>

3. Run the frontend and backend using: `npm start`.

## How to work with Knex.js

Knex is a SQL query builder, mainly used for Node.js applications with built in model schema creation, table migrations, connection pooling and seeding.

### Install Knex and Knex Command Line Tool

Install `knex` **globally** on your local computer.

```bash
$ npm install knex -g
```

This will allow us to use `knex` as a command line tool that helps you create and manage your knex files.

In addition, you will need to also install the `knex` module **locally** to use in your project.

```bash
$ npm install knex --save
```

## Configuring your database

We're going to be connecting to a MySQL database, we'll need to install the `mysql` module.

```
$ npm install mysql --save
```

We can start by creating a `knexfile.js` in the root of your project which will act as our configuration for different environments, (e.g. â€“ local development vs production).

```
$ knex init
```

This will create a `knexfile.js` with the different configurations for the different environments.
